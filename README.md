A library that makes coding in Rust just a little bit simpler. 

To set this up:
1. In the dependencies section of the Cargo.toml file, paste the following line in:
c_implifier = {git = "https://github.com/PolarBeeDev/c_implifier", branch = "master"}
2. Then, in your .rs file, you can write: use c_implifier::[the gen of the commands]
3. Now, you can call the commands

Example:

Cargo.toml:
![dependencies-example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6931e76-6eff-45ef-b15f-63706438de2b)

main.rs:
![mainrs-example](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a15b58a-2d0f-4d29-81fa-0cd2cf1b9dd3)
